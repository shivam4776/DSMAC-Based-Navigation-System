# DSMAC-Based-Navigation-System
A Windows application suite designed to simulate and evaluate aircraft or missile navigation in GPS-denied environments using vision-based techniques.

üõ∞Ô∏è Overview
In long-range navigation, traditional Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) tend to drift, and GPS signals are prone to spoofing or jamming. This project implements a DSMAC (Digital Scene-Matching Area Correlation) approach to enable robust and accurate navigation without relying on GPS.

The project consists of two core applications:

DCAS (Data Creation and Stitching App)
Automates the collection of aerial image data from Google Earth Pro using .kml input files, and saves images with associated latitude-longitude coordinates for training.

Flight Test Simulator
Simulates an aircraft flight over an input aerial map. Allows setting of waypoints, altitude, and speed, captures real-time images during flight, and tests image-matching models to evaluate navigation accuracy.

üîç Features
Simulated aircraft navigation with image capturing

Aerial data scraping using Google Earth Pro and KML files

Image matching using:

ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF)

FAISS with ResNet-50 feature extraction

Error analysis with visualization of predicted vs actual coordinates

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
Python (PyQt5 for GUI)

OpenCV (for ORB)

FAISS + PyTorch (ResNet-50)

Google Earth Pro (for image collection)

Matplotlib / Plotly (for visualizations)

üñ•Ô∏è How to Run
DCAS App

Open the app

Load your .kml file

Start the image scraping process

Output: Aerial images + metadata (lat-long)

Flight Test Simulator

Load an aerial map

Set waypoints, speed, and altitude

Start the navigation simulation

Captured images will be saved automatically

Load a trained model (ORB or FAISS)

Run test and view accuracy results (min, max, avg error in meters)
